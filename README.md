Your task is to recreate a responsive design in Flutter where the component size adjusts based on the screen size.

Instructions:

Recreate a Responsive Design: Your objective is to recreate a design that demonstrates responsiveness in Flutter. The design should consist of components whose sizes adapt to different screen sizes. You can use a design from Figma, a whiteboard sketch, or any other source of your choice.

Responsive Components: Focus on creating components that adjust their sizes dynamically according to the screen dimensions. This will highlight your understanding of responsive UI development in Flutter.

Task Description: Create cards that follow the responsive-design pattern. Sepcifically, the task require
you to create 2 differen cards on the same screen:
Card 1 (The card at the top):
As the screen size grows or shrinks, the width of the card changes to occupy the same porpotion of
the screen. Furthermore, the green-area inside it also grows to take the same proportion of the screen
as before.
Card 2 (The card at the bottom):
Ad the screen size grows or shrinks, the width of the card changes to occupy the same poportion of
the screen. Furthermore, the green-area inside it also changes. Also note that, even though the size of
the card is changing, the grey-area still maintains its size and remains at the top-center of the card.
Note:
* The while area represent a screen (mobile screen, web-browser screen, ipad screen, etc).
â€¢ The red-ish area is being refered to as card.
* Extra points if you can implement this without using "MediaQuery".
